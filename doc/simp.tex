\section{Model equations in strong form} \label{sec:strongform}

Our conservation of momentum model for ice flow is the set of shear-thinning (Glen law) Stokes equations with glacier-suitable boundary conditions.\footnote{version: \today}  This model is described in \cite{GreveBlatter2009,JouvetRappaz2011}.  For these notes it applies on a 2D domain $\Omega$ occupied by the ice, in variables $(x,z)$ with $z$ vertical.  The domain $\Omega \subset \RR^2$ which must have a piecewise smooth boundary so that we may apply the boundary conditions, and in fact it will evolve, but it is otherwise general.

Allowing any Glen exponent $n\ge 1$, the strong form model equations are:
\begin{align}
- \nabla \cdot \tau + \nabla p &= \rho \bg &&\text{\emph{stress balance}} \label{forcebalance} \\
\nabla \cdot \bu &= 0 &&\text{\emph{incompressibility}} \label{incompressible} \\
\tau &= B_n |D\bu|^{(1/n) - 1} D\bu  &&\text{\emph{viscosity-form flow law}} \label{viscflowlaw}
\end{align}
Here we have velocity $\bu$, pressure $p$, ice density $\rho$ (constant), deviatoric stress tensor $\tau$, and strain rate tensor $D\bu$.  The acceleration of gravity is $\bg = \left<g\sin\alpha,-g\cos\alpha\right>$ where $g>0$ and $\alpha$ is an optional angle allowed for (e.g.) exact solutions.

Regarding tensors, recall $D\bu$ is the symmetric part of $\grad \bu$, i.e.~$(D\bu)_{ij} = \frac{1}{2} \left(\grad\bu + \grad\bu^\top\right)$, and the tensor norm is $|D\bu|^2 = \frac{1}{2} \trace\left((D\bu)^2\right) = \frac{1}{2} (D\bu)_{ij} (D\bu)_{ij}$.  Since $D\bu$ is symmetric and has trace zero by \eqref{incompressible}, the same holds for $\tau$.  The full (Cauchy) stress tensor $\sigma$ is the deviatoric part $\tau$ minus the pressure, $\sigma = \tau - p\,I$, so equation \eqref{forcebalance} states $-\Div \sigma = \rho \bg$.  For linear Stokes equations we would replace \eqref{viscflowlaw} by $\tau = 2\nu D\bu$, thus we say here that $\nu=(1/2)B_n |D\bu|^{(1/n) - 1}$ is the \emph{effective viscosity}.  Note $B_n = (A_n)^{-1/n}$ is the $n$-dependent \emph{ice hardness} in units $\text{Pa}\,\text{s}^{1/n}$.

From \eqref{viscflowlaw} we can eliminate $\tau$ from equation \eqref{forcebalance}, thereby rewriting the system in terms of velocity and pressure only:
\begin{align}
- \nabla \cdot \left(B_n |D\bu|^{(1/n) - 1} D\bu\right) + \nabla p &= \rho \mathbf{g} \label{stokes} \\
\Div \bu &= 0 \label{incompagain}
\end{align}
This system is the Glen-Stokes model, and a solution is a velocity-pressure pair $(\bu,p)$.

Certain glacier-suitable velocity and stress boundary conditions will be used here.  We assume that the base, top, inflow, and outflow boundaries can all be identified.  Note that the inflow and outflow boundaries may be empty but we assume that the base and top are nonempty.  On the base, for this first version of the model, we require no slip:
\begin{align}
\bu &= \bzero  &&\text{\emph{base}} \label{basebc} \\
\intertext{On the top we set a condition of zero applied stress, i.e.~$\sigma\hbn=0$ where $\hbn$ is the outward normal:}
\left(B_n |D\bu|^{\frac{1}{n} - 1} D\bu - pI\right) \hbn &= \bzero  &&\text{\emph{top}} \label{topbc} \\
\intertext{One the inflow boundary we require a prescribed inflow velocity:}
\bu &= \bu_{\text{in}}  &&\text{\emph{inflow}} \label{inflowbc} \\
\intertext{On the outflow boundary we set a nonzero hydrostatic normal stress determined by the ice thickness $H_{\text{out}}$ at the outflow, which must be known:}
\left(B_n |D\bu|^{\frac{1}{n} - 1} D\bu - pI\right) \hbn &= -\rho \bg (H_{\text{out}}-z) &&\text{\emph{outflow}} \label{outflowbc}
\end{align}
If $\alpha=0$ and the boundary is vertical then this boundary condition corresponds to zero traction tangent to the boundary and hydrostatic pressure applied normally.

The above equations determine the velocity and pressure in the ice from the boundary conditions, and from the geometry of the ice domain $\Omega$, but they do not determine how the glacier changes shape.  One aspect of conservation of mass is already stated above, namely the incompressibility relation in the interior of $\Omega$, but to evolve the glacier geometry we will need to add the conservation of mass statement on $\partial\Omega$, namely the surface kinematical equation.  To present this equation we suppose that the domain is time-dependent:
\begin{equation}
\Omega^t = \left\{(x,z)\,\big|\, b(x) < z < h(x,t)\right\}.  \label{Omegat}
\end{equation}
Here $z=b(x)$ is the base elevation and $z=h(x,t)$ is the ice surface elevation, and note the key fact that
\begin{equation}
h(x,t) \ge b(x).  \label{admissibility}
\end{equation}
Denoting the ice velocity components as $\bu=\left<u(x,z,t),w(x,z,t)\right>$, the surface kinematical equation is
\begin{equation}
h_t = a(x,h,t) - u(x,h,t) h_x + w(x,h,t) \label{surfacekinematical}
\end{equation}
Here $a(x,z,t)$ is the (modeled) climatic mass balance in (ice-equivalent) units $\text{m}\,\text{s}^{-1}$.  Informally, \eqref{surfacekinematical} changes the surface elevation $\Delta h \approx h_t\,\Delta t$ using the climatically added/removed ice $a\,\Delta t$ plus the component of the ice motion in the outward (upward) normal direction $\hbn = \left<-h_x,1\right>$.  That is, one may say that the time-dependent surface $z=h(x,t)$ evolves by steps $\Delta h \approx \left(a + \hbn\cdot \bu|_{z=h}\right) \Delta t$, but in fact we will solve \eqref{surfacekinematical} implicitly, that is, coupled with the Stokes equations \eqref{stokes}, \eqref{incompagain} and the other boundary conditions.


\section{Weak form of the decoupled Glen-Stokes equations} \label{sec:weakformstokes}

At any time $t$, by well-posedness \cite{JouvetRappaz2011}, if the ice geometry $\Omega^t$ is known then the solution to Glen-Stokes model \eqref{stokes}, \eqref{incompagain} is a unique pair of functions $(\bu,p)$.  That is, in a Stokes model the slowness of the fluid ($\text{Re}=0$) implies that the boundary stresses and body force determine its velocity and pressure fields without any ``memory'' of prior states; there is no influence from inertia.  For this situation, as is standard in the literature, one may write a weak form for the variable-viscosity momentum-balance equations, decoupled from the mass conservation boundary equation \eqref{surfacekinematical}.  We state this decoupled weak form so as to set notation and have a familiar starting point, before describing the coupled, implicit geometry evolution in the next section.

For the weak form we seek a solution $\bu\in V_D \subset W^{1,p}(\Omega^t)$ and $p \in Q=L^{p'}(\Omega^t)$.  Test functions $\bv\in V_0 \subset W^{1,p}(\Omega^t)$ and $q\in Q$ come from nearly the same spaces: $\bu\in V_D$ satisfies base and inflow boundary conditions \eqref{basebc} and \eqref{inflowbc}, respectively, while $\bv\in V_0$ is zero on those boundaries.  FIXME: clarify function spaces

To give an initial definition of the nonlinear functional which defines the weak form, we multiply \eqref{stokes} by $\bv\in V_0$ and \eqref{incompagain} by $q\in Q$, then add and integrate-by-parts:
\begin{equation}
\tilde F = -\int_{\partial\Omega^t} (\sigma \hbn)\cdot \bv\,ds + \int_{\Omega^t} \tau \,:\,D\bv - p (\nabla \cdot \bv) - \left(\nabla \cdot \bu\right) q - \rho \mathbf{g} \cdot \bv \,dx dz \label{nonfunctwo}
\end{equation}
where $ds$ is the arclength element along $\partial\Omega^t$, and denoting $\sigma=\tau-pI$ for brevity.  Note that $\bu,\bv$ appear with at most first derivatives and $p,q$ appear without derivatives.

By definition, $\bv\in V_0$ satisfies $\bv=\bzero$ along the base and inflow surfaces.  Thus these parts of the integral over $\partial\Omega$ in \eqref{nonfunctwo} are zero.  The stress-free condition \eqref{topbc} on the top surface and the outflow condition \eqref{outflowbc} on the outflow boundary denoted $\partial_O \Omega^t$, now completely eliminate the unknowns from the boundary integral, yielding a final formula for $\tilde F$:
\begin{align}
\tilde F &= \int_{\Omega^t} B_n |D\bu|^{\frac{1}{n} - 1} D\bu\,:\,D\bv - p (\nabla \cdot \bv) - \left(\nabla \cdot \bu\right) q \,dx dz \label{defineF} \\
    &\qquad  - \int_{\Omega^t} \rho \mathbf{g} \cdot \bv \,dx dz + \int_{\partial_O \Omega^t} \rho (H_{\text{out}}-z) \bg \cdot \bv \,ds \notag
\end{align}
The last two integrals can be regarded as source terms.  In fact, if the inflow velocity is zero and these source terms are also zero, for instance because gravity is turned off ($\bg=\bzero$), then the unique solution is $\bu=\bzero$ and $p=0$.  The weak form is the statement that $\bu\in V_D$ and $p\in Q$ satisfy
\begin{equation}
\tilde F(\bu,p;\bv,q) = 0 \qquad \text{ for all } \bv\in V_0 \text{ and } q\in Q  \label{weak}
\end{equation}

An equivalent weak formulation is proven in \cite[Theorem 3.8]{JouvetRappaz2011} to be well-posed under reasonable assumptions about the domain $\Omega$ and boundary data which are satisfied in the cases we consider.


\section{Implicit time-discretization} \label{sec:implicitstep}

We propose an implicit moving-mesh scheme to simultaneously solve the Glen-Stokes equations and the surface kinematical equation.  We compute the ice strain (displacement) during a time step implicitly from the simultaneous principles of mass and momentum conservation.  In writing the weak formulation of this scheme, stated using a time-discretized, continuous-space formulation, the main task is to change variables in the integrals which define the above Stokes weak form.  The finite element solution of the resulting equations is considered in the next section.

Initially we will describe the time-stepping using a backward Euler scheme, a somewhat inflexible presentation.  Better implicit schemes exist, and in later work we could state the problem as a differential algebraic equation (DAE) and apply a higher-order scheme like a second-order backward-differentiation formula (BDF2) \cite{AscherPetzold1998}, and use tools like PETSc's TS object \cite{Balayetal2020,BuelerBook} or \texttt{firedrake-ts}.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/IvanYashchuk/firedrake-ts}}

Consider consecutive times $t_{n-1}$ and $t_n$ with step $\Delta t = t_n - t_{n-1} > 0$.  Suppose the model's state, namely the (current) ice geometry, is known at time $t_{n-1}$.  Denote this ice-filled domain as $\Lambda = \Omega^{t_{n-1}} \subset \RR^2$.  We will approximate the updated (new) domain $\Omega^n = \Omega^{t_n} \subset \RR^2$ using the surface kinematical equation \eqref{surfacekinematical}, the surface mass balance $a(x,z,t)$, and the Glen-Stokes equations \eqref{weak}.

The coordinates on the current region $\Lambda$ are denoted $(r,s)$.  We update the region via a particular change of coordinates $(r,s) \mapsto (x,z)$:
\begin{equation}
\Lambda \stackrel{\Delta t}{\to} \Omega^n: \qquad x(r,s)=r, \quad z(r,s)=s+c(r,s). \label{changecoords}
\end{equation}
Here $c(r,s)$ is a scalar function which is to be determined (below).  Note that the horizontal coordinate is not changed ($x=r$) but the $z$-coordinate is nontrivial.  The new domain $\Omega^n$ is an image of the current domain $\Lambda$,
\begin{equation}
\Omega^n = \{(x,z)=(r,s+c(r,s)) \,\big|\, (r,s) \in \Lambda\}.  \label{updateddomain}
\end{equation}

FIXME a figure here showing $\Lambda$ on left and $\Omega^n$ on right

The top of the icy region will be described by a surface elevation function, but this requires we acknowledge a ``shallowness'' assumption, namely that for every $x$-coordinate value there are well-defined surface and base elevation values.  That is, from now on we assume that
\begin{equation}
I(r) = \{s\,:\,(r,s) \in \Lambda\} \subset \RR \, \text{ is a single interval}\label{intervalassume}
\end{equation}
for every $r$.  In fact $I(r)$ is open, because $\Lambda$ is itself open, but this is of no importance in the following.  While statement \eqref{intervalassume} is an assumption about $\Lambda$, the current icy domain, once we have solved all the upcoming equations the same fact must also hold for $\Omega^n$, that is, so that time-stepping may proceed.  Now
    $$h(r) = \sup I(r), \qquad b(r) = \inf I(r)$$
define the ice-surface and base elevation functions for the current domain $\Lambda$.  (One could denote $h(r)$ as $h^{n-1}(r)$, but we de-clutter this notation.)

The change of coordinates will be differentiable within $\Lambda$.  (This is because the nontrivial part, the function $c$, will solve an elliptic PDE; see below.)  From \eqref{changecoords} the Jacobian of the change is
\begin{equation}
J = \begin{pmatrix} \partial x / \partial r & \partial x / \partial s \\ {\large\strut} \partial z / \partial r & \partial z / \partial s \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ \partial c/\partial r & 1+(\partial c/\partial s) \end{pmatrix}. \label{jacchange}
\end{equation}
For a generic, smooth, scalar-valued function $\tilde f(x,z)$ defined on $\Omega^n$ we define a new function on $\Lambda$,
    $$f(r,s) = \tilde f(r,s+c(r,s)),$$
and partial derivatives transform as
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix} \partial \tilde f / \partial x \\ {\large\strut} \partial \tilde f / \partial z\end{bmatrix} = (J^\top)^{-1} \begin{bmatrix} \partial f / \partial r \\ {\large\strut} \partial f / \partial s\end{bmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & \ell \\ 0 & k \end{pmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \partial f / \partial r \\ {\large\strut} \partial f / \partial s\end{bmatrix} \label{changederivatives}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
j(r,s) = 1+\frac{\partial c}{\partial s}, \qquad k(r,s) = j(r,s)^{-1}, \qquad \ell(r,s) = - \frac{\partial c}{\partial r}(r,s) j(r,s)^{-1}. \label{definejkl}
\end{equation}

With these formulas we can rewrite the surface kinematical equation \eqref{surfacekinematical}.  First, given \eqref{updateddomain}, the updated ice surface elevation is
    $$h^n(r) = z(r,h(r)) = h(r) + c(r,h(r)),$$
defined for $r$ in $\Lambda$.  The value $c(r,h(r))$ is defined in a trace sense \cite{Evans2010}; see below for the Sobolev space containing $c$.  The backward-Euler form of \eqref{surfacekinematical} will approximate the time derivative by $h_t \approx (h^n(r) - h(r))/\Delta t$, thus at the location $(r,h^n(r))$ on the boundary of $\Omega^n$, \eqref{surfacekinematical} becomes
\begin{align}
\frac{c(r,h(r))}{\Delta t} &= a^n(r) - u(r,h(r))\,\frac{d}{d r} h^n(r) + w(r,h(r)) \notag \\
  &= a^n(r) - u(r,h(r))\,\left(h'(r) + \frac{\partial c}{\partial r}(r,h(r)) + h'(r) \frac{\partial c}{\partial s}(r,h(r))\right) + w(r,h(r)) \label{surfaceimplicitearly}
\end{align}
where $\bu(r,s)=\left<u,w\right>$ is the solution of the other equations (i.e.~the Stokes weak form; see below) as a function of $(r,s)\in\Lambda$.  Also $a^n(r) = a\left(r,h(r) + c(r,h(r)),t_n\right)$ is the mass balance computed at the updated surface location and the updated time.  Stated more simply, \eqref{surfaceimplicitearly} will be regarded as a Robin boundary condition for the unknown function $c(r,s)$ at an arbitrary surface location of $\Lambda$:
\begin{equation}
c + \Delta t\,u \frac{\partial c}{\partial r} + \Delta t\,(1+h') u \frac{\partial c}{\partial s} = \Delta t \left(a^n + w\right). \label{surfaceimplicit}
\end{equation}
Note \eqref{surfaceimplicit} implies a coupling between surface elevation and mass balance during the solve, a complication which can be avoided by the (semi-explicit) approximation using the current surface elevation: $a^n \approx a(r,h(r),t_n)$.

As we will be rewriting the weak form \eqref{defineF} as integrals over $(r,s)\in \Lambda$, note the following expansions of the derivatives with respect to $(x,z)$.  In particular we use \eqref{changederivatives} and component notation $\bu = \left<u_0,u_2\right>$, compatible with coordinate notation $(x,z)$ on $\Omega$:
\begin{align*}
\grad_{x,z} \cdot \tilde \bu &= \frac{\partial u_0}{\partial r} + \ell \frac{\partial u_0}{\partial s} + k \frac{\partial u_2}{\partial s} \\
D_{x,z} \tilde \bu &= \begin{pmatrix} \partial u_0/\partial r + \ell (\partial u_0/\partial s) & \frac{1}{2}\left(k (\partial u_0/\partial s) + \partial u_2/\partial r + \ell (\partial u_2/\partial s)\right) \\
  {\large\strut} \frac{1}{2}\left(k (\partial u_0/\partial s) + \partial u_2/\partial r + \ell (\partial u_2/\partial s)\right) & k (\partial u_2/\partial s)\end{pmatrix} \\
|D_{x,z} \tilde \bu|^2 &= \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial u_0}{\partial r} + \ell \frac{\partial u_0}{\partial s}\right)^2 + \frac{1}{2}\left(k \frac{\partial u_0}{\partial s} + \frac{\partial u_2}{\partial r} + \ell \frac{\partial u_2}{\partial s}\right)^2 + \frac{1}{2}\left(k \frac{\partial u_2}{\partial s}\right)^2 \\
\end{align*}

The change of variables also rewrites integrals over the solution domain $\Omega^n$.  For example, consider a generic scalar-valued $L^1$ function $\tilde f(x,z)$ defined on $\Omega^n$.  By the change of variables theorem we have
\begin{equation}
\int_{\Omega^n} \tilde f(x,z)\,dx dz = \int_\Lambda \tilde f(x(r,s),z(r,s)) \, j(r,s)\,dr ds, \label{changeintegralearly}
\end{equation}
with weighting $j(r,s)$, equal to the determinant of $J$, defined above in \eqref{definejkl}.  For stability the change of coordinates must not cause a local flip in orientation,though degeneration is allowed.  That is, we will require $j\ge 0$ or equivalently
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial c}{\partial s} \ge -1.\label{differentialVI}
\end{equation}
For integral \eqref{changeintegralearly} we again denote the function defined on $\Lambda$ by $f(r,s) = \tilde f(r,s+c(r,s))$, and thus we get a final integral change-of-variables formula
\begin{equation}
\int_{\Omega^n} \tilde f(x,z)\,dx dz = \int_\Lambda f(r,s) \, j(r,s)\,dr ds. \label{changeintegral}
\end{equation}


FIXME state the weak form using independent variables $r,s$ and integrals over $\Lambda$


\section{Inequality constraints and mass accounting}

\begin{lemma}
Assume that the ice thickness is well defined at time $t_{n-1}$, that is, assume
\eqref{intervalassume}.  If inequality \eqref{differentialVI} holds then the updated ice surface elevation
    $$h(r,t_n) = \sup_{s\in I(r)}\{z(r,s)\}$$
satisfies \eqref{admissibility}, i.e.~$h(r,t_n)\ge b(r)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
FIXME? This is the fundamental theorem of calculus:
    $$h(r,t_n) - b(r) = \int_{I(r)} 1\,ds \le \int_{I(r)} - \frac{\partial c}{\partial s}\,ds$$
\end{proof}

FIXME Main points:
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\arabic{enumi}.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item equations are for four scalar functions $u,v,p,c$, of $(r,s) \in \Lambda$, where $\bu=\left<u,v\right>$ is the vector velocity, $p$ is the pressure, and $c$ is the vertical mesh displacement
\item the $z$ value at the ice surface solves the time-discretized surface kinematical equation re-written into $(r,s)$ coordinates; this is a Robin boundary condition for $c$
\item in the interior of $\Lambda$, the difference $c(r,s)=z(r,s)-s$ solves the Laplace equation subject to boundary values as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Robin on surface from surface kinematical equation
    \item zero Dirichlet on base and inflow; these mesh nodes do not move
    \item Neuman on outflow
    \end{itemize}
\item numerical solver should check element orientation under change of coordinates (above); if the solver flips an element then it is bad; also check new element aspect ratio and (presumably) remesh if that is bad
\item the initial iterate for the (SNES-based) solver is clear: $\bu,p$ come from solution of previous time step, and $b$ starts at zero
\end{enumerate}
