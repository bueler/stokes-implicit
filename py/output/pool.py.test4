stage 4:            topography on top of high-aspect, GMG in z and AMG in base
extruded mesh:      4 x 4 x 2 prisms(x2)
domain:             100000.00 x 100000.00 base domain with 500.00 < z < 1500.00 at surface
vector space dims:  n_u=1215, n_p=96  -->  N=1311
  Linear s_ solve converged due to CONVERGED_RTOL iterations 86
  semi-coarsening:  GMG levels = 1
  solution norms:   |u|_2 = 5.479e+01,  |p|_2 = 1.682e+13
