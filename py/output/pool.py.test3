stage 3:            topography on top of unit-cube, GMG in z only
extruded mesh:      4 x 4 x 4 prisms(x2)
domain:             1.00 x 1.00 base domain with 0.50 < z < 1.50 at surface
vector space dims:  n_u=2187, n_p=160  -->  N=2347
  Linear s_ solve converged due to CONVERGED_RTOL iterations 20
  semi-coarsening:  GMG levels = 2
  solution norms:   |u|_2 = 8.323e-02,  |p|_2 = 4.916e+00
