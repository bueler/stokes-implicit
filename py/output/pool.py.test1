stage 1:            lid-driven unit-cube cavity, 3D GMG
extruded mesh:      4 x 4 x 4 prisms(x2)
domain:             1.00 x 1.00 x 1.00
vector space dims:  n_u=2187, n_p=160  -->  N=2347
  Linear s_ solve converged due to CONVERGED_RTOL iterations 12
  3D coarsening:    GMG levels = 3
  solution norms:   |u|_2 = 1.985e-01,  |p|_2 = 1.869e+00
