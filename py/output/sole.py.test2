stage 2:            extruded semicoarsening in z, unit aspect, GMG in z and AMG in base
extruded mesh:      4 x 4 x 4 mesh of Q1 hex elements on 1.00 x 1.00 x 1.00 domain
vector space dim:   N=125
  Linear s_ solve converged due to CONVERGED_RTOL iterations 3
  semi-coarsening:  GMG levels = 2, coarse-level AMG levels = 2
  L_2 error norm = 0.0403377
