The most important questions in glaciology concern how the climate around a glacier determines its geometry.  The shape of a glacier evolves through surface mass processes (especially precipitation, melt, and runoff), and also boundary stresses, as the ice flows.  Existing glacier and ice sheet models are poorly-suited to fast computation of the resulting geometry evolution, especially at large scale and over long duration.  The behavior is diffusive in the large (lubrication approximation), but also subject to a free surface condition which extends to a moving free boundary (glacier margin) in the map-plane.  This talk will address the finite element solution of a nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP; a variational inequality) which states the geometric free-boundary problem, coupled to a non-Newtonian Glen-Stokes flow model for conservation of momentum.  This implicit time-stepping model has no shallowness approximations.  Our mixed-element approach exploits Firedrake and PETSc.  Existing models solve this problem with conditionally-stable explicit steps for geometry evolution, with much smaller time steps than intrinsic to the flow, but here we target O(1) year time steps at any resolution on realistically-rough bedrock topography, with progress toward optimal solver complexity.
