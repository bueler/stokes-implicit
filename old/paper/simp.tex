\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

The most important questions in glaciology concern how the climate around a glacier determines its geometry, both through climatic mass balance (i.e.~precipitation, ablation, and runoff) and stresses along the ice surface.  Internal ice flow dynamics responds to these inputs.  In particular, relationships between surface mass inputs and the geometry of the ice mass are important because they affect sea level, deformations of the Earth's crust, and fresh water supplies, for example.  In this context, evolving-geometry simulations are used by scientists to understand the size and extent of glaciers and ice sheets.  A variety of methodologies for such numerical simulations are seen in practice, with most of the well-established schemes involving shallow approximations of the continuum equations \cite[for example]{Hoffmanetal2018,Lipscombetal2019,Winkelmannetal2011}.  Furthermore, most methods use explicit or semi-implicit time-stepping \cite{HindmarshPayne1996,Hoffmanetal2018,Lipscombetal2019,Winkelmannetal2011}, and thus small stability-imposed time steps at high spatial resolution, though fully-implicit exceptions exist \cite{Brinkerhoffetal2017,Bueler2016}.  The performance properties of present-day numerical models therefore limit either the physical modeling authenticity (due to shallowness and other approximations) or the spatial resolution (due to solver performance limitations).  In particular, the quality of ensemble simulations, regarding tradeoffs between the number of ensemble members and the capability of the individual simulations, is directly limited by numerical model performance.

This paper\footnote{version: \today.} addresses an important, but also restricted, class of numerical glacier and ice sheet models which are based on conservation of momentum and mass, without shallowness assumptions.  For conservation of momentum we use the standard shear-thinning (Glen) power-law Stokes model of the ice fluid.  Noting that ``mass conservation'' properly refers both to fluid incompressibility and to conservation at the ice surface, we simultaneously solve the zero-divergence equation for bulk ice \emph{and} the surface kinematical equation (or kinematic boundary condition \cite{GreveBlatter2009}), in which the climatic (surface) mass balance is a source term.  We model two- and three-dimensional grounded glaciers and ice sheets for which there is a well-defined ice thickness (Figure \ref{fig:context}); overhanging ice is not modeled.  The ice thickness is defined at all map-plane points but it is zero in those locations where the (coupled and solved) equations determine there is no ice.  Thus the solution process determines the glacier extent, and the location of the free boundary at the ice margin \cite{SchoofHewitt2013}, simultaneously with the ice velocity and pressure.

\caption{We consider 3D models of grounded glaciers and ice sheets based on Glen-Stokes ice flow, an evolving free surface, and a free boundary.}
\label{fig:context}
\end{figure}

We do not, however, consider the conservation of energy, and neither thermomechanical coupling nor basal melt are included in our model.  A further restriction is that our ice sticks to the bed (no slip), and we do not consider floating ice.  These restrictions are all removable by well-known modeling mechanisms \cite[for example]{Aschwandenetal2012,Winkelmannetal2011}, but how they would affect model is a topic for further research.

A substantial fraction (sections \ref{sec:perturb}--\ref{sec:weakforms}) of this paper concerns the time semi-discretized model, wherein each time step solves an inequality-constrained, continuous-space problem.  We will be concerned with, but not resolve, the mathematical well-posedness of the equations describing a time step in this model.

Starting in section \ref{sec:finiteelement} we discretize the continuum equations in space with a finite element (FE) method \cite{Elmanetal2014} implemented using the Firedrake library \cite{Rathgeberetal2016} in Python.  (The programs are open-source at \href{https://github.com/bueler/stokes-implicit}{\texttt{github.com/bueler/stokes-implicit}}.)  We use meshes which are unstructured in the map-plane but which are extruded \cite{Bercea2016,Gibsonetal2019,McRaeetal2016} in the vertical direction.  Mixed elements for velocity, pressure, and a vertical ice strain surrogate (section \ref{sec:implicitstep}) are used, with stable and aspect-ratio robust choices for the velocity-pressure (i.e.~Stokes) block \cite{Elmanetal2014}.  Solutions of the resulting nonlinear discrete equations apply multigrid-preconditioned Newton-Krylov methods \cite{Bueler2021}, with semicoarsening in the vertical direction \cite{Tuminaroetal2016}.  All computations are parallelized via application of the PETSc library \cite{Balayetal2020}.

A model performance metric introduced here is a natural one for glacier modeling.  Namely, we measure the run time of our coupled Glen-Stokes simulations relative to the well-understood computation of ice velocity in the shallow ice approximation (SIA) \cite{Fowler1997} on the same mesh.  That is, we define a glacier model ``work unit'' as the time needed for a diagnostic computation of the SIA horizontal velocity solution.

A primary purpose of this paper is to understand the performance characteristics of numerical simulations using fully-implicit, evolving-surface Glen-Stokes models.  At each time step the stress balance, incompressibility, and surface kinematical equations are solved simultaneously to within a tolerance on the coupled residual.  Time steps of order one year are targeted but we identify geometry error metrics may be used to limit and adjust time steps.  To evaluate our approach we validate the model based on results of laboratory experiments, we compare the performance of the model with shallow models, we demonstrate solver optimality and scalability, and we show a solution for the Greenland ice sheet.  At the end we identify spatial resolutions at which the performance of our model would actually exceed that of explicit time-stepping SIA models.


\section{Existing methods in the literature}  \label{sec:literature}

FIXME time-dependent numerical solvers for free surface flows exist outside of glacier applications; approaches like the marker-and-cell method \cite{HarlowWelch1965} make explicit updates to the fluid surface but these are understood to have diffusion-type stability limitations where the maximum time step scales with the square of spatial mesh sizes; we will see this along the way; in such terms our target here is the implementation of very long time steps, e.g.~hundreds to millions of times longer than stable explicit (diffusional) time-steps

FIXME indeed we seek the direct computation of steady states as has been demonstrated for the lubrication approximation (SIA) case in \cite{Bueler2016}

FIXME compare literature of existing solvers for glaciers and ice sheets:

\item  nonevolving surface Stokes \cite{IsaacStadlerGhattas2015,Lengetal2013,Lengetal2014a,Zwingeretal2007} (CHECK)

FIXME note Wirbel \& Jarosch \cite{WirbelJarosch2020} come closest; WHAT TO MAKE OF ``Following the problem definition of the free–surface evolution as a variational inequality [$S\ge B$ where $S$ is surface elevation and $B$ is bed], the possible solutions of the surface elevation $S$ belong to a complex set, in other words, the surface elevation $S$ cannot fall below a constraint, which is the glacier bed elevation B.  As we introduced an artificial ice layer of thickness $h_{af}$ to construct a 3D volume mesh over the entire domain, this constraint is defined as $\tilde B = B + h_{af}$ \dots  In order to eliminate the effect of the artificial ice layer on the free–surface evolution, we introduce subdomains separating ice–covered and ice–free areas of the computational domain.  In subdomain 1, where there is actual ice ($S > \tilde B$), the full form of [SKE] is solved, whereas in subdomain 2, where no ice is present ($S = \tilde B$), [SKE] reduces to: $\partial S/\partial t=\dot a$.  These subdomains are defined according to ice thickness.  In order to allow the glacier to advance into previously ice-free areas, subdomain 1 is enlarged by a velocity–dependent buffer zone. Additionally, velocities within the artificial ice layer are set to zero.''

\section{Equations for ice flow in glaciers} \label{sec:strongform}

The standard model for the flow of glaciers uses Stokes equations based upon Glen's shear-thinning flow law for ice \cite{GreveBlatter2009,JouvetRappaz2011,SchoofHewitt2013}.  We will consider this model on time-dependent $d=2,3$ dimensional domains $\Omega^t \subset \RR^d$ (Figure \ref{fig:domainnotation}) for time $t>0$ and spatial variables $\bx=(x,y,z)$, with $z$ vertical.  We generally present the equations assuming $d=3$, but in 2D the coordinates are denoted $(x,z)$.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figs/domainnotation.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Surface mass balance $a$ and bed elevation $b$ are defined on all of the computational domain $R$.  The evolving ice domain $\Omega^t$ has projection $\pi \Omega^t \subset R$.}
\label{fig:domainnotation}
\end{figure}

Allowing any Glen exponent $n\ge 1$, the (strong-form) equations for bulk ice in $\Omega^t$ are:
\begin{align}
- \nabla \cdot \tau + \nabla p &= \rhoi \bg &&\text{\emph{stress balance}} \label{forcebalance} \\
\nabla \cdot \bu &= 0 &&\text{\emph{incompressibility}} \label{incompressible} \\
\tau &= B_n |D\bu|^{(1/n) - 1} D\bu  &&\text{\emph{flow law}} \label{viscflowlaw}
\end{align}
Solution fields are velocity $\bu$, pressure $p$, and the deviatoric stress tensor $\tau$.  In concrete computational cases later in the paper we use constant ice density $\rhoi=910 \,\text{kg}\,\text{m}^{-3}$ and gravity $\bg=\left<0,0,-g\right>$, with $g=9.81\,\text{m}\,\text{s}^{-2}$.  Note $B_n$ is the $n$-dependent ice hardness; values $n=3$ and $B_n=6.8082\times 10^7\,\text{Pa}\,\text{s}^{1/3}$ \cite{Bueleretal2005} are used in computations.

Regarding tensors and their notation, the full (Cauchy) stress tensor $\sigma$ \cite{GreveBlatter2009} decomposes into the deviatoric part $\tau$ minus the pressure, i.e.~$\sigma = \tau - p\,I$, so equation \eqref{forcebalance} simply says $-\Div \sigma = \rhoi \bg$.  The strain rate tensor $D\bu$ is the symmetric part of $\grad \bu$: \,$(D\bu)_{ij} = \frac{1}{2} \left(\grad\bu + \grad\bu^\top\right)$.  Because $D\bu$ is symmetric, and because it has trace zero by equation \eqref{incompressible}, i.e.~$\trace(D\bu)=\nabla \cdot \bu = 0$, from equation \eqref{viscflowlaw} it follows that $\tau$ is also symmetric with trace zero.  The tensor norm in \eqref{viscflowlaw} satisfies $|D\bu|^2 = \frac{1}{2} \trace\left((D\bu)^2\right) = \frac{1}{2} (D\bu)_{ij} (D\bu)_{ij}$.

For the $n=1$ linear Stokes equations \cite{Elmanetal2014} one traditionally writes \eqref{viscflowlaw} as $\tau = 2\nu D\bu$ with viscosity $\nu = (1/2) B_1$.  For powers $n>1$, namely shear-thinning ice, one may define an ``effective viscosity'' which involves a negative power of the strain rate norm $|D\bu|$.  This effective viscosity would be singular in the limit of small strain rates, and so, motivated by the actual finite viscosity of glacier ice \cite{GreveBlatter2009}, we define the regularized effective viscosity
\begin{equation}
\nu_\eps(|D\bu|) = \frac{1}{2} B_n \left(|D\bu|^2 + \eps\, D_0^2\right)^{(r-2)/2}, \label{regeffvisc}
\end{equation}
where $\eps = 10^{-4}$ and $r=(1/n)+1=4/3$ in computations.  The constant $D_0$ defines a strain-rate scale for glacier flow; $D_0 = 2 \,\text{a}^{-1}$, used in computations, corresponds to a velocity difference of 1000 meters per year in a distance of 500 meters.

Using \eqref{regeffvisc} we eliminate $\tau$ from equation \eqref{forcebalance} and rewrite a system, in terms of velocity and pressure derivatives only, which applies on $\Omega^t$:
\begin{align}
- \nabla \cdot \left(2 \nu_\eps(|D\bu|)\, D\bu\right) + \nabla p &= \rhoi \mathbf{g} \label{stokes} \\
\Div \bu &= 0 \label{incompagain}
\end{align}
The solution to this Glen-Stokes model for bulk ice motion is a velocity-pressure pair $(\bu,p)$, from which one may derive strain rates $D\bu$ and thus stresses $\tau$ and $\sigma$ as needed.

Glacier-suitable dynamic boundary conditions will be used, with an emphasis on isolated and grounded ice sheets.  In such cases the ice flow extends in the horizontal direction until a free boundary at the glacier margin is reached.  Real glacier margins may occur as fracture-generated cliffs, but such non-fluid processes are not modeled here.  As already noted we assume that the ice thickness is well-defined, and thus the top and bottom boundaries of $\Omega^t$ can be identified.  On top we set a condition of zero applied stress,
\begin{equation}
\left(2 \nu_\eps(|D\bu|) D\bu - pI\right) \bn = \bzero  \qquad \qquad \text{\emph{on the top} } \overline{\partial} \Omega^t, \label{topbc}
\end{equation}
where $\bn$ is the (outward) normal to the surface.  (It is straightforward, and not interesting, to provide a nonzero atmospheric pressure at the surface.)  On the base we require no slip:
\begin{equation}
\bu = \bzero  \qquad\qquad \text{\emph{on the base} } \underline{\partial} \Omega^t. \label{basebc}
\end{equation}
Optionally, to allow simulation of a certain laboratory experiment \cite{SayagWorster2013} (below), we allow inflow.  A prescribed velocity $\bu = \bu_{\text{in}}$ is applied on an inflow boundary $\partial_{\text{in}} \Omega^t$, subject to $\bu_{\text{in}}\cdot \bn \le 0$.

The well-posedness of the above model \eqref{regeffvisc}--\eqref{basebc} is proven by \cite{JouvetRappaz2011}.  Thus if the ice geometry $\Omega^t$ is known then the solution is a unique pair $(\bu,p)$.  Note that the slowness of the fluid, i.e.~zero Reynolds number, implies that at each instant the boundary stresses and body forces determine the velocity and pressure fields without any ``memory'' of prior states or influence from inertia, as would be needed in the Navier-Stokes equations \cite{Fowler1997}.


\section{Ice geometry evolution} \label{sec:stronggeometry}

The above equations do not describe how a glacier changes shape or extent.  This process, coupled to the flow velocity but not fully determined by it, is described by an additional equation which states conservation of mass on the top boundary $\overline{\partial} \Omega^t$.  To present this equation we first assume a larger map-plane domain $R\subset \RR^{d-1}$ on which the surface mass balance and bedrock elevation data of the problem are defined; again see Figure \ref{fig:domainnotation}.  We will consider only isolated glaciers and ice sheets, so ice must not be present on, nor flow across, the boundary of $R$, and the ice-covered area $\pi\Omega^t$ is a compact subset of $R$.

Let $z=b(x,y)$ be the bedrock elevation, assumed continuously-differentiable and time-independent for simplicity, and $z=h(t,x,y)$ the ice surface elevation; both functions are defined for all $(x,y)\in R$.  The function $h$ is part of the solution while $b$ is input data.  The following form for the time-dependent, open ice domain is assumed:
\begin{equation}
\Omega^t = \left\{\bx\,\big|\,(x,y)\in R \,\text{ and }\, b(x,y) < z < h(t,x,y)\right\}.  \label{Omegat}
\end{equation}
Note that an admissibility requirement for $h$, as a part of the model solution, is that at each $t>0$ and $(x,y)\in R$ we have $h(t,x,y) \ge b(x,y)$.  On the other hand, at any given map-plane location $(x,y)$ the ice may be present (strict inequality) or absent (equality) in an evolving, time-dependent manner.

In agreement with almost all ice sheet and glacier modeling literature, \eqref{Omegat} states that the upper and lower surfaces of the ice mass are described by well-defined functions of map-plane location.  The domain $\Omega^t$ is thus a layer \cite{Bueler2020}, and not general.  Furthermore we assume a disjoint boundary decomposition $\partial \Omega^t = \overline{\partial} \Omega^t \cup \underline{\partial} \Omega^t$.  Looking ahead, this layer assumption is compatible with a vertically-extruded, unstructured map-plane mesh FE method (section \ref{sec:finiteelement}).

Let $a(t,x,y,z)$ be the modeled climatic surface mass balance, in (ice-equivalent) units $\text{m}\,\text{s}^{-1}$.  This scalar field must be defined for all locations above the bedrock elevation, i.e.~ for $z \in R\times[b(x,y),\infty)$ when $(x,y)\in R$.  Denoting the velocity as $\bu=\left<u,v,w\right>$, the surface kinematical equation \cite{GreveBlatter2009} then applies on the top of the ice, namely $\frac{\partial h}{\partial t} = a - u \frac{\partial h}{\partial x} - v \frac{\partial h}{\partial y} + w$ or, stated using vector notation,
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial h}{\partial t} = a + \bu \cdot \bn \quad \text{ on } \overline{\partial}\Omega^t, \label{surfacekinematical}
\end{equation}
where $\bn = \left<-\frac{\partial h}{\partial x},-\frac{\partial h}{\partial y},1\right>$ points upward and is normal to the ice surface.  The surface mass balance $a$ in \eqref{surfacekinematical} is the trace \cite{Evans2010} of the mass balance along the ice surface, i.e.~$a = a(t,x,y,h(t,x,y))$, and similarly for the velocity $\bu = \bu(t,x,y,h(t,x,y))$.  Equation \eqref{surfacekinematical} is often regarded as similar to an advection of $h$, or the ice thickness, but because ice also tends to flow downhill, i.e. generally speaking $\bu \sim -\grad h$, the equation is diffusive at large scale when bedrock geometry is sufficiently smooth.

Modeled melting or freeze-on at the ice base would add a basal kinematic equation \cite[for example]{Aschwandenetal2012}, analogous to \eqref{surfacekinematical}, but for simplicity this is not considered here.

Equation \eqref{surfacekinematical} applies on the ice surface, thus only where ice is present.  However, \eqref{surfacekinematical} should actually be understood as the following problem for the entire computational domain $R$ \cite{Bueler2016,Calvoetal2002,JouvetBueler2012,SchoofHewitt2013}:
\begin{align}
h-b &\ge 0, \label{strongadmissibility} \\
\frac{\partial h}{\partial t} - a - \bu \cdot \bn &\ge 0, \label{stronginequality} \\
(h-b) \left(\frac{\partial h}{\partial t} - a - \bu \cdot \bn\right) &= 0. \label{strongcomplementarity}
\end{align}
These statements, which form a nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) \cite{KinderlehrerStampacchia1980}, avoid referring to glacier extent, which we regard as an aspect of the solution.  Equation \eqref{strongcomplementarity}, the complementarity principle, says that either there is no ice at the location ($h=b$) or ice is present and equation \eqref{surfacekinematical} applies.  At ice-free locations, where $\partial h/\partial t=0$ and $\bu=\bzero$, \eqref{stronginequality} says that $a \le 0$, that is, the surface mass balance is not positive.  Physically-speaking, at such locations snow melt and runoff exceed solid (snow) precipitation.

The NCP \eqref{strongadmissibility}--\eqref{strongcomplementarity} can be regarded as having only the time-dependent surface elevation $h$ as the unknown or state vector.  In particular, where $\bu$ appears in the NCP it is the value of a nonlinear and nonlocal map from ice geometry to the surface value of the solution velocity $\bu$, namely by solving \eqref{regeffvisc}--\eqref{basebc}.  That is, the velocity $\bu$ in the surface kinematical equation, whether stated as the classic equation \eqref{surfacekinematical} or through the NCP, can be written as ``$\bu(h)$'' if desired.

Informally, but commonly in the ice sheet modeling literature, the surface kinematical equation determines how the ice surface elevation is ``updated'': the climatically added or removed ice $a\,\Delta t$, plus the component of the ice motion in direction $\bn$, determines the vertical displacement of the surface.  That is, most numerical glacier models evolve the time-dependent surface $z=h$ by explicit steps, i.e.~$\Delta h \approx \left(a + \bu\cdot \bn\right) \Delta t$ in the simplest forward-Euler case, based upon the current values of $a$, $\bu$, and $\bn$ (i.e.~$\grad h$).  However, for the current paper we will solve \eqref{surfacekinematical}, more precisely \eqref{strongadmissibility}--\eqref{strongcomplementarity}, implicitly and coupled with the Glen-Stokes system \eqref{regeffvisc}--\eqref{basebc}.  The new ice surface will be compatible with the new flow when the solver has converged.

Note that the mass balance $a(t,x,y,z)$ is computed using a separate model for the dynamical state of the atmosphere, one which computes snow precipitation, (atmospheric) energy-driven melt at snow/ice surfaces, and liquid water runoff.  How this is done is well beyond our scope, but we emphasize it is important that, in moving-margin glacier simulations, $a$ have a well-defined value both at the current ice surface and elsewhere, or at least nearby.  A simulated glacier can only advance into ice-free areas, retreat from ice-covered areas, and undergo changes of surface elevation if the source term at the new locations is well-defined.  This issue can be ignored for explicit time-steps, but not here.


\section{Time steps and geometry perturbations} \label{sec:perturb}

We intend to solve the coupled problem \eqref{regeffvisc}--\eqref{basebc}, \eqref{strongadmissibility}--\eqref{strongcomplementarity} to yield a triple of functions $\bu,p,h$ where, in particular, the surface elevation $h$ is defined on $(t,x,y) \in [0,\infty)\times R$.  According to definition \eqref{Omegat}, $h$ determines the domains $\Omega^t\subset \RR^d$ on which the velocity and pressure $\bu,p$ are meaningful, so the problem has some kind of free-boundary character.  Furthermore, inequalities \eqref{strongadmissibility} and \eqref{stronginequality} make it clear that we are not solving a classical system of coupled PDEs.

In this section we describe this inequality-constrained evolving-geometry problem in a time semi-discretized, but continuous space, framework.  So that we may examine the numerical stability of the implicit time-stepping method in the next section, we consider how small perturbations of surface elevation would evolve.  We will address the stability of forward and backward Euler time steps, i.e.~the simplest explicit and implicit schemes, respectively, in our semi-discretized context.

Because this continuous-space framework is not the common way to analyze scheme stability,\footnote{Scheme stability for numerical PDEs is usually addressed in a spatially semi-discrete framework, namely the \emph{method of lines} \cite{LeVeque2007}, or in a fully-discrete framework \cite{MortonMayers2005}.} we sketch the framework for an abstract linear evolution PDE
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial q}{\partial t} = L q, \label{linearevolve}
\end{equation}
with $q=q(t,x)$, $x$ in some spatial domain, and $L$ a generally-unbounded, time-independent operator on some function space $\mathcal{X}$.  In some generality, namely when $L$ generates a strongly-continuous semigroup \cite{Evans2010}, we can regard the solution of \eqref{linearevolve} as $q = e^{tL} q_0$ where $q_0 \in \mathcal{X}$.  That is, solving the PDE generates a bounded solution operator $\phi_t$ on $\mathcal{X}$ for each $t\ge 0$
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial q}{\partial t} = L q \qquad \implies \qquad \phi_t = e^{t\,L}. \label{linearexact}
\end{equation}
Over some duration $\Delta t$ the exact solution process can be written
    $$q(t+\Delta t) = \phi_{\Delta t}\, q(t) = e^{\Delta t\,L} q(t).$$
(Dependence on $x$ is suppressed here.)  For comparison, a single explicit forward-Euler time-step generates an approximation of the exact solution operator, namely
\begin{equation}
\frac{q^{n}-q^{n-1}}{\Delta t} = L q^{n-1} \qquad \implies \qquad \phi^E_{\Delta t} = I + \Delta t\,L, \label{linearexplicit}
\end{equation}
as does an implicit backward-Euler step
\begin{equation}
\frac{q^{n}-q^{n-1}}{\Delta t} = L q^{n} \qquad \implies \qquad \phi^I_{\Delta t} = (I - \Delta t\,L)^{-1}. \label{linearimplicit}
\end{equation}
Observe that $\phi_{\Delta t}$, $\phi^E_{\Delta t}$, and $\phi^I_{\Delta t}$ are linear operators on the same space $\mathcal{X}$ and that both methods approximate the exact step to first order: $\phi^{\{E,I\}}_{\Delta t} - \phi_{\Delta t} = O(\Delta t^1)$.

However, in the case where the spatial domain is bounded and the operator $L$ is a typical differential operator, the approximate solution operators have very different quality.  Consider these two cases where $L$ is a well-known differential operator:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{$L=\grad^2$ is the Laplacian on a bounded domain with self-adjoint boundary conditions}:  Since $L$ has only eigenvalue spectrum \cite{Evans2010}, with the eigenvalues going to $-\infty$, the exact solution operator $\phi_{\Delta t} = e^{\Delta t\,L}$ is a compact (bounded) operator, as is the backward Euler operator $\phi^I_{\Delta t} = (I - \Delta t\,L)^{-1}$.  However the forward Euler operator $\phi^E_{\Delta t} = I + \Delta t\,L$ is actually unbounded.  Under a spatial discretization with resolution $h$, in which $\phi^{E,h}_{\Delta t} = I + \Delta t\,L^h$ acts on a finite-dimensional space $\mathcal{X}^h\subset \mathcal{X}$, one may impose a time step restriction $\Delta t < O(h^2)$ so that, when it acts only on the mesh-supported spatial modes $\phi^{E,h}_{\Delta t}$, is bounded (and indeed a contraction).  Thereby the forward Euler scheme in the fully-discrete context is a conditionally-stable scheme.
\item \emph{$L=\bw \cdot \grad$ is an advection operator, with fixed nonzero velocity $\bw$, on a bounded, periodic domain}:  Again $L$ has only eigenvalue spectrum, now with the eigenvalues going to infinity in both imaginary directions, so the exact solution operator $\phi_{\Delta t} = e^{\Delta t\,L}$ is a unitary (bounded) operator.  The backward Euler operator $\phi^I_{\Delta t} = (I - \Delta t\,L)^{-1}$ is actually compact because its eigenvalues depart from the unit circle and converge to zero.  However, the forward Euler operator $\phi^E_{\Delta t} = I + \Delta t\,L$ is again unbounded.  Under a spatial discretization with resolution $h$ one may impose the CFL time-step restriction $\Delta t < O(h^1)$ \cite{LeVeque2007} and then the forward Euler scheme functions as a conditionally-stable fully-discrete scheme.
\end{itemize}
This completes our summary of the time-semi-discretized theory of linear evolution equations, so we return to evolving-geometry glaciers.

FIXME: the inequality context changes the framework, but does not completely ruin it; we still want to send bounded sets to compact, thus nearly finite-dimensional, sets

Let $\mathcal{X}$ be a Banach space of real-valued functions on $R \subset \RR^{d-1}$ containing the bed elevation function $b$.  Let
    $$\mathcal{K} = \{h \in \mathcal{X}\,:\,h \ge b\}$$
be the closed and convex subset of admissible surface elevation functions.  Associated to this set we have a pointwise truncation map $\PiK : \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{K}$ given by $\PiK f = \max\{b,f\}$.

Because the gradient of $h$ appears in stating our problem, namely in conditions \eqref{topbc}, \eqref{stronginequality}, and \eqref{strongcomplementarity}, we suppose $\mathcal{X}$ is in fact a Sobolev space \cite{Evans2010}, perhaps $W^{1,p}(R)$ for some $p\ge 1$.  While it it is not apparent from the literature which is the correct or natural space $\mathcal{X}$, in the smooth-bed SIA simplified model one would regard it as the space of $n/(2n+2) = 3/8$ powers of functions from $W^{1,n+1}(R)=W^{1,4}(R)$ \cite{JouvetBueler2012}.  In any case, we require of the space that functions $f\in \mathcal{X}$ are continuous, a property satisfied by $W^{1,p}(R)$ if $p>d-1$ \cite[theorem 5.6.5]{Evans2010}, and that $\PiK$ defined above is continuous.

Now fix $h_0 \in \mathcal{K}$ and, assuming well-posedness of the coupled problem, consider the coupled solution over an increment of time $[t,t+\Delta t]$ starting from this surface elevation.  At the final time $t+\Delta t$ this solution includes a surface elevation $h_1 \in \mathcal{K}$ (along with velocity and pressure fields which are not needed here).  If one perturbs the initial geometry to $h_0+\delta h_0$ then a coupled solution generates a different surface elevation $h_1+\delta h_1$.  However, because parts of $R$ are not occupied by ice, or have thin ice, even small-magnitude surface elevation perturbations are in general constrained by the requirement that the surface be above the bed.  Therefore, for surface elevations $h_0$ and $h_1$ we define spaces of admissible geometry perturbations
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{K}_i = \left\{\delta h \in \mathcal{X} \,:\, \delta h \ge b - h_i\right\}  \label{admissibleperturbations}
\end{equation}
for $i=0,1$.  Note $h_i+\delta h \in \mathcal{K}$ is equivalent to $\delta h \in \mathcal{K}_i$.

The exact (coupled) solution process is a nonlinear operator on surface elevation perturbations:
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{a,\Delta t} : \mathcal{K}_0 \to \mathcal{K}_1. \label{perturboperatorexact}
\end{equation}
This map is defined as follows: For $\delta h_0 \in \mathcal{K}_0$ solve the coupled problem \eqref{regeffvisc}--\eqref{basebc}, \eqref{strongadmissibility}--\eqref{strongcomplementarity}, which includes the inequality constraints of the NCP, over the time interval $[t,t+\Delta t]$ using initial geometry $h_0+\delta h_0 \in \mathcal{K}$ and using the generally time-dependent surface mass balance $a$ (i.e.~defined on $[t,t+\Delta t]\times R$).  This generates a surface elevation solution $\hout \in \mathcal{K}$.  From $\hout$ we calculate $\Phi_{a,\Delta t} (\delta h_0) = \delta h_1 = \hout - h_1 \in \mathcal{K}_1$.

The action of $\Phi_{a,\Delta t}$ in \eqref{perturboperatorexact} obviously nonlinear.  Furthermore, because of the inequality constraints, there is no reason to suppose it is differentiable.  On the other hand, one may reasonably expect continuity because decades of observations of glacier dynamics give strong evidence that in all but rare ``tipping-point'' configurations, small input geometry perturbations generate proportionately-small output perturbations.  Even in tipping-point cases one expects small output effects by choosing sufficiently-small input perturbations (though with no claim of proportionality).

Now, a single-stage \cite{AscherPetzold1998} time-stepping scheme for the same coupled problem would be unstable if it caused small-magnitude, typically high-spatial-frequency, perturbations to grow by a fixed factor, greater than one, in a manner which feeds back to stimulate the same type of mode.  Thus we will compare such schemes to the exact operator in \eqref{perturboperatorexact}.

To be precise about single-stage schemes we first specify our preferred surface mass balance field, namely the average
\begin{equation}
\bar a(x,y,z) = \frac{1}{\Delta t} \int_t^{t+\Delta t} a(\tau,x,y,z)\,d\tau.  \label{smbaverage}
\end{equation}
A single-stage scheme must hold the surface mass balance, used in solving the coupled problem, at some value over the duration of the time step $[t,t+\Delta t]$, and from now on we will assume it is the value $\bar a$ in \eqref{smbaverage}.  (More complicated schemes would, by definition, not be single-stage.)

Existing Stokes-based schemes for evolving glacier geometry (section \ref{sec:literature}) solve the coupled problem explicitly by the following procedure.  They first solve for $\bu,p$, then apply the explicit approximation of the surface kinematical equation \eqref{surfacekinematical}, using \eqref{smbaverage} for the mass balance (we assume), and then truncate the resulting surface elevation.  The last step is required because the explicit approximation of \eqref{surfacekinematical}, even when computed on the current ice surface, may, in places, generate surface elevation values below the bed elevation, and indeed this generically happens when the margin retreats.

The stability properties of such Stokes-based explicit schemes is largely unexplored.  However, it is clear that even in areas where the ice is thick and the mass balance is positive, that is, even where the constraints are not active, time steps cannot be arbitrarily large.  One argument for why such schemes are at best conditionally-stable is that for large, thin, low-angle, grounded, frozen-base ice sheets such schemes must produce essentially the same results as the lubrication approximation (SIA), a nonlinear diffusion \cite{Calvoetal2002,JouvetBueler2012}.  A second argument is that the literature provides no numerical evidence for long stable steps from such schemes.

To analyze the stability of Stokes-based explicit schemes we regard them as operators on perturbations comparable to the exact map $\Phi_{a,\Delta t}$ in \eqref{perturboperatorexact}.  For simplicity we present only the forward Euler case.  First we must determine the unperturbed result $\hat h_1$ from the scheme, which is not the exact result $h_1$ used in defining \eqref{perturboperatorexact}.  For this we start from geometry $h_0$ and solve only the Stokes problem \eqref{regeffvisc}--\eqref{basebc} to yield $\bu,p$.  The velocity $\bu$ is then used in the forward Euler approximation of the surface kinematical equation \eqref{surfacekinematical} to compute $\Delta h = \left(a + \bu\cdot \bn\right) \Delta t$.  However, $h_0+\Delta h$ is generally not admissible (in $\mathcal{K}$) so we truncate to get $h^E_1 = \PiK(h_0+\Delta h)$.  As in \eqref{admissibleperturbations} this defines a set $\mathcal{K}^E_1=\{\delta h \,:\, \delta h \ge b - h^E_1\}$ of admissible output perturbations.  Next, the map on perturbations
\begin{equation}
\Phi^E_{\bar a,\Delta t} : \mathcal{K}_0 \to \mathcal{K}^E_1 \label{perturboperatorexplicit}
\end{equation}
is computed by the following steps.  From $\delta h_0 \in \mathcal{K}_0$ let $h_0+\delta h_0$ determine the ice geometry and solve the Stokes problem \eqref{regeffvisc}--\eqref{basebc} to yield $\bu,p$.  Use the velocity $\bu$ in the forward Euler approximation of the surface kinematical equation \eqref{surfacekinematical} to update the surface, but then truncate to get an admissible geometry, and then subtract to get the admissible output perturbation:
\begin{equation}
\Phi^E_{\bar a,\Delta t}(\delta h_0) = \PiK\Big(\hin + \left(\bar a + \bu_{[\hin]} \cdot \bn_{[\hin]}\right) \Delta t\Big) - h^E_1 \qquad \text{where } \hin=h_0+\delta h_0. \label{perturboperatorexplicitaction}
\end{equation}
In summary, an explicit scheme for geometry evolution acts by time-splitting \cite{LeVeque2007},
    $$\text{solve Stokes} \to \text{update surface} \to \text{truncate to admissible geometry},$$
and \eqref{perturboperatorexplicitaction} gives the precise action of such a scheme on perturbations.

Compare the action of an implicit time-step scheme, here backward Euler for simplicity.  FIXME
\begin{equation}
\Phi^I_{\bar a,\Delta t} : \mathcal{K}_0 \to \mathcal{K}^I_1. \label{perturboperatorimplicit}
\end{equation}

FIXME note that the three $\Phi$ do not even have the same output spaces, but still we expect both $\Phi^E_{\bar a,\Delta t} = \Phi_{\bar a,\Delta t} + O(\Delta t^1)$ and similarly for $\Phi^I$; but the ops are really different;  we expect for the ice problem that $\Phi^E_{\bar a,\Delta t}$ generates large magnitude perturbations for some norm one inputs while $\Phi^I_{\bar a,\Delta t}$ (and the exact) are compact in the same sense as in the linear case

FIXME positive $\delta h$ always allowed; small positive $\delta h$ with small support cause change in velocity field equivalent to the addition of a Stokeslet; alternative is doublet $/\backslash/$ with zero added volume \cite{ChwangWu1975}; the former is longer range and the latter short


\section{Implicit time-stepping via a domain mapping} \label{sec:implicitstep}

Our main purpose is to demonstrate an effective implicit scheme to solve the evolving geometry problem \eqref{regeffvisc}--\eqref{basebc}, \eqref{strongadmissibility}--\eqref{strongcomplementarity}.  The only time derivative in this coupled problem appears in the surface kinematical expression, i.e.~in \eqref{stronginequality} and \eqref{strongcomplementarity}.  Because the remaining equations and boundary conditions lack time derivatives, but apply at all times, the coupled problem should be understood as an infinite-dimensional differential algebraic equation (DAE) problem \cite{AscherPetzold1998}, with added inequality constraints.

The fundamental issue faced by implicit time-stepping schemes for glaciers is that the icy domain will change during the time step.  Either in terms of the 3D, ice-occupied continuum domain $\Omega^t$ of the coupled PDE problem, or in terms of the numerical 3D mesh (section \ref{sec:finiteelement}), one can only solve for ice velocity and pressure in locations where ice or mesh exists.  Concretely, supposing $t_{n-1}$ and $t_n$ are consecutive times with step $\Delta t = t_n - t_{n-1} > 0$, the possibility of glacier advance and retreat during an implicit step requires the PDE domain to cover the current ice at $t_{n-1}$, and compute the ice flow solution at locations where ice is present once we have solved the equations for the new time $t_n$.

In this section, using a discrete-time and continuous-space formulation, we state our scheme for solving this problem.  A new feature is that at each time step we compute a vertical-only displacement field which captures the effect of the surface kinematical equation along the boundary but which is defined everywhere within the same ``reference'' domain as the velocity and pressure.  The coupled solution, including this vertical displacement, then determines the new domain of ice.

We discretize the coupled problem in time using the first-order backward Euler method.  Higher-order implicit schemes exist, including stiff-decay backward-differentiation schemes \cite{AscherPetzold1998,Bueler2021} suitable for DAE problems.  However, because of the inequality constraints, the numerical errors associated to determining the free boundary are unavoidably of low order in time and space \cite{Bueler2020} and tend to dominate over time-stepping errors made in well-behaved locations.  Effective application of higher-order time-stepping is a topic for future research.

\label{fig:domainupdate}
\end{figure}

Our scheme uses the current ice geometry to construct a reference domain on which the velocity, pressure, and vertical displacement are computed by the coupled PDEs.  The detailed construction of the reference domain, given next, is not as important as the main idea:
\begin{quote}
\emph{the coupled PDEs are solved on a domain which supports the new ice geometry.}
\end{quote}
Elimination or creation of ice in any map-plane location must be allowed, so changes in the map-plane topology, as a glacier disconnects for example, must also be allowed.

Let $\Href>0$ be a reference glacier thickness, a value such that grounded ice of uniform thickness $\Href$ flows slowly over the bedrock topography, and which is small compared to observed glacier thicknesses.  For example, $\Href=50$ m might be appropriate for small mountain glaciers while for large, cold, and low-angle ice sheets we might choose $\Href=200$ m.  (Recall that the velocity of Glen $n=3$ ice in a slab-on-slope geometry \cite{GreveBlatter2009} goes as the $4$th power of the ice thickness.)

Suppose $h^{n-1}(x,y) \approx h(t_{n-1},x,y)$ is an admissible current surface elevation, i.e.~such that $h^{n-1}\ge b$.  As in \eqref{Omegat}, denote the corresponding ice domain by $\Omega^{n-1}=\{\bx\,\big|\,(x,y)\in R, b(x,y)<z<h^{n-1}(x,y)\} \subset \RR^3$; see the top of Figure \ref{fig:domainupdate}.  Let
\begin{equation}
\lambda(x,y) = b(x,y) + \left[\Href^2 + (h^{n-1}(x,y) - b(x,y))^2\right]^{1/2} \label{definelambda}
\end{equation}
% alternative:  \lambda(x,y) = b(x,y) + \max\{\Href,h^{n-1}(x,y)-b(x,y)\}
The reference domain then has surface $z=\lambda(x,y)$:
\begin{equation}
\Lambda = \left\{(\xi,\eta,\zeta)\,\big|\,(\xi,\eta)\in R, \, b(\xi,\eta) < \zeta < \lambda(\xi,\eta)\right\}.  \label{Lambda}
\end{equation}
Domain $\Lambda$ has positive thickness (height) everywhere and a surface slope nearly matching that of $h^{n-1}$ where ice is thick; see Figure \ref{fig:domainupdate}.  Observe that $\lambda$ and $\Lambda$ are fully determined by data which are known at the start of the time step.  Also note that $\lambda \ge h^{n-1} \ge b$, $\lambda \to h^{n-1}$ for large ice thickness ($h^{n-1}-b\to\infty$), $\lambda \to h^{n-1}$ as $\Href\to 0$, and $\Omega^{n-1} \subset \Lambda$.  If $h^{n-1}$ and $b$ are smooth then $\lambda$ is smooth, but we do not, in fact, expect smoothness of $h^{n-1}$ for real glaciers even when $b$ is smooth.

From now on $\bxi=(\xi,\eta,\zeta)$ will denote coordinates on $\Lambda \subset \RR^3$.  We will compute the updated domain $\Omega^n \subset \RR^3$ (Figure \ref{fig:domainupdate}) via a change of coordinates, a map
\begin{equation}
\bx(\bxi) = \bxi + (0,0,c(\bxi)) \label{changecoords}
\end{equation}
with nontrivial $z$ coordinate.  This map is based on a scalar, vertical ``displacement'' function $c(\bxi)$ which is defined on $\Lambda$ and satisfies certain properties, one being preservation of the bedrock elevation
\begin{equation}
c(\xi,\eta,b(\xi,\eta))=0. \label{mapbasetobase}
\end{equation}
The domain $\Omega^n$ is defined to be the interior of the image of $\Lambda$ under map \eqref{changecoords}:
\begin{equation}
\Omega^n = \{\bx(\bxi) \,\big|\, \bxi \in \Lambda\}^\circ. \label{updateddomain}
\end{equation}
Determining $c(\bxi)$ on $\Lambda$ therefore determines $\Omega^n$.

Since $c(\bxi)$ will solve an elliptic PDE (below), map \eqref{changecoords} will be smooth from $\Lambda$ to $\Omega^n$, but it is degenerate, i.e.~generally non-invertible.  In particular, the topological interior in \eqref{updateddomain} is generally necessary because the map will collapse ice-free locations to zero height, which are then outside $\Omega^n$.  (Here ``ice--free'' refers to the solution geometry.)

The computed surface elevation $h(\xi,\eta)\approx h(t_n,\xi,\eta)$, including the upper boundary of $\Omega^n$, will be defined on all of $R$.  Its value is defined to be the maximum mapped $z$ coordinate in each column:
\begin{equation}
h(\xi,\eta) = \lambda(\xi,\eta) + c(\xi,\eta,\lambda(\xi,\eta)), \label{maptoptotop}
\end{equation}
which would follow if map \eqref{changecoords} is (non-strictly) monotonic in each column, including the possibility that an entire column is mapped to a single height, namely $b$.  Thus the top of the reference domain is sent to the top of the new ice domain.  Furthermore, because the map will be differentiable, it follows from \eqref{mapbasetobase}, \eqref{maptoptotop}, monotonicity, and the requirement that $h$ be admissible ($h\ge b$) that
\begin{equation}
1 + \frac{\partial c}{\partial \zeta}(\bxi) = \frac{\partial z}{\partial \zeta}(\bxi) \ge 0. \label{mapmonotonic}
\end{equation}
That is, the map is a nondecreasing function in each column.

Let $I=(b(\xi,\eta),\lambda(\xi,\eta))$ be the interval of a column.  In locations which are computed to be ice free we have
\begin{equation}
h(\xi,\eta)=b(\xi,\eta) \quad \implies \quad b(\xi,\eta) = \zeta + c(\xi,\eta,\zeta) \text{ for all } \zeta \in I, \label{mapcrushes}
\end{equation}
that is, map \eqref{changecoords} sends the entire column to the bed elevation; $c$ is then fully-determined by a linear formula: $c(\xi,\eta,\zeta) = b(\xi,\eta) - \zeta$ (Figure \ref{fig:mapI}).

\begin{figure}[ht]
\input{tikz/mapI.tex}
\caption{The map $\bx:\Lambda \to \Omega^n$ in \eqref{changecoords} takes a column $I$ with surface elevation $\lambda$ to one of elevation $h$.  The column can grow (left), shrink (middle), or yield no ice (right) according to the top boundary condition \eqref{claplacetop}, an equation in $c$ and $\bu$.}
\label{fig:mapI}
\end{figure}

On the other hand, our purpose is to solve surface kinematical equation \eqref{surfacekinematical} with a backward Euler step.  We include this equation in the coupled system on $\Lambda$.  Where there is ice (\emph{in the solution}) we want the discretized form of \eqref{surfacekinematical} to apply:
\begin{equation}
h(\xi,\eta)>b(\xi,\eta) \quad \implies \quad h - h^{n-1} = \Delta t\left(a + \bu \cdot \bn\right). \label{backwardeulerskeearly}
\end{equation}
The quantities in the right-hand equation are evaluated at the solution ice surface $\zeta=h(\xi,\eta)$, i.e.~on the top boundary of $\Omega^n$ at the new time $t_n$.  As we are actually seeking to solve NCP \eqref{strongadmissibility}--\eqref{strongcomplementarity}, we emphasize that \eqref{backwardeulerskeearly} applies only where ice is present in the solution geometry.

The implicit surface kinematical equation \eqref{backwardeulerskeearly} will, by \eqref{maptoptotop}, be regarded as another condition on the displacement function $c$, which then determines map \eqref{changecoords}.  Analogous to how the normal boundary field on the undeformed reference configuration is used in the theory of elasticity, in particular as in the free-boundary Signorini problem \cite[sections 2.6 and 6.2]{Stewart2011}, we will approximate the normal direction in \eqref{backwardeulerskeearly} using the reference domain normal $\bn_\Lambda$ and not the normal on the computed domain $\Omega^n$.  Combined with \eqref{maptoptotop} this replaces \eqref{backwardeulerskeearly} with
\begin{equation}
h(\xi,\eta)>b(\xi,\eta) \quad \implies \quad c(\xi,\eta,\lambda(\xi,\eta)) = h^{n-1} + \Delta t\left(a + \bu \cdot \bn_\Lambda\right) - \lambda(\xi,\eta). \label{backwardeulerske}
\end{equation}

We now have multiple requirements on the scalar function $c(\bxi)$, specifically equations \eqref{mapbasetobase}, \eqref{mapmonotonic}, \eqref{mapcrushes}, and \eqref{backwardeulerske}.  Generally these requirements cannot all be satisfied by a smooth function $c$ on $\Lambda$.  The function $c$ would, at least, necessarily have discontinuities along the boundary of $\Lambda$ because, as one passes from an ice-free location (equation \eqref{mapcrushes}) to one with ice (equation \eqref{backwardeulerske}), i.e.~across an ice margin, $c$ will generally jump.

However, our plan is to compute a well-defined function $c$ which satisfies requirements \eqref{mapbasetobase} and \eqref{backwardeulerske} along the boundary $\partial \Lambda$.  Furthermore this function will be smooth in (the interior of) $\Lambda$.  In locations where the solution has no ice, on the top boundary of $\Lambda$ we set the value given by \eqref{mapcrushes}: $c=b-\lambda$.  However, within $\Lambda$ we sacrifice conditions \eqref{mapmonotonic} and \eqref{mapcrushes}.

In our scheme the vertical displacement $c(\bxi)$ solves an anisotropic Laplace boundary value problem on $\Lambda$:
\begin{align}
        \Div(M_\alpha \grad c) &= 0 &&\text{in } \Lambda \label{claplace} \\
                c &= \begin{cases} b-\lambda, & h \le b + 0.1\Href \\
                                   h^{n-1} + \Delta t\left(a + \bu \cdot \bn_\Lambda\right) - \lambda, & h>b+0.1\Href \end{cases} &&\text{top: } \overline{\partial} \Lambda  \label{claplacetop} \\
                c &= 0 &&\text{base: } \underline{\partial} \Lambda,  \label{claplacebase} \\
 \grad c\cdot \bn &= 0 &&\text{sides: } \partial_{|} \Lambda  \label{claplacesides}
\end{align}
where
    $$M_\alpha = \begin{bmatrix} \alpha & & \\ & \alpha & \\ & & 1 \end{bmatrix}$$
and $0<\alpha\le 1$.  The top boundary condition \eqref{claplacetop}, which follows from \eqref{mapcrushes} and \eqref{backwardeulerske}.  The Neumann boundary condition on the vertical sides of $\Lambda$, above $\partial R$ and denoted $\partial_{|} \Lambda$, removes influences from outside of the computational domain.  Figure \ref{fig:claplaceproblem} sketches this problem.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{figs/claplaceproblem.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Sketch of reference domain $\Lambda$ and problem \eqref{claplace}--\eqref{claplacesides}.  See the text regarding the top boundary condition \eqref{claplacetop}.}
\label{fig:claplaceproblem}
\end{figure}

Regarding boundary condition \eqref{claplacetop}, note that if the glacier is in equilibrium with the climate then $\lambda \approx h^{n-1}$ and $a+\bu\cdot\bn=0$, thus this boundary condition says $c\approx 0$.  However, in ice free areas, because by construction the domain $\Lambda$ always has thickness at least $\Href$, we have $c=b-\lambda \le -\Href$.  For glaciers near equilibrium, and also for short time steps $\Delta t$, we thus expect $c$ to be around zero along the surface of the current ice but significantly negative in ice-free areas.

The value of ``$h$'' in the top boundary condition \eqref{claplacetop} used in the two cases is the new (solution) surface elevation, that is, the elevation of the top of the ice domain \emph{after} applying the map $\bxi\mapsto \bx$.  This value depends on $c$ through equation \eqref{maptoptotop}.  (Looking ahead, condition \eqref{claplacetop} will be included into the coupled system as a boundary integral term in a mixed-space weak form (see section \ref{sec:finiteelement}).)  In the $h>b$ case the quantities $a,\bu,\bn_\Lambda$ in \eqref{claplacetop} are evaluated along the top of $\Lambda$, i.e.~at $\zeta=\lambda(\xi,\eta)$.  Note these locations are mapped using $c$ to the surface of the solution ice, i.e.~the top boundary of $\Omega^n$, while $\bn_\Lambda = \left<-\frac{\partial\lambda}{\partial\xi},-\frac{\partial\lambda}{\partial\eta},1\right>$ is not unit.

Solving problem \eqref{claplace}--\eqref{claplacesides} yields a smooth 3D function $c$ which, in each vertical column of $\Lambda$, connects either the surface kinematical quantity \eqref{backwardeulerske} or the ice-free case \eqref{mapcrushes} as linearly as possible to zero at the base.  That is, $c$ satisfies a maximum principle in $\Lambda$ \cite{Evans2010}, and the direction of $\grad c$ changes direction as little as possible in the energy norm $\|v\|_\alpha^2 = \int_\Lambda \grad v \cdot M_\alpha \grad v\,d\bx$ while smoothly meeting the boundary data.  Use of the small parameter $\alpha>0$, e.g.~$\alpha=0.1$ used in computations, implies that variations in the vertical ($\zeta$) are more suppressed than variations in the horizontal ($\xi,\eta$).  As noted above, the various constraints on $c$ imply rapid variation in $c$ across the glacier margin position, but we nonetheless, by choosing $\alpha$ relatively small, we seek near-linearity of $c$ in eash column of $\Lambda$.

The weak form of the coupled problem, stated in the next section, will require derivatives of coordinate transformation \eqref{changecoords}.  The Jacobian is
\begin{equation}
J(\bxi) = \frac{\partial \bx}{\partial \bm{\xi}} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ \strut 0 & 1 & 0 \\ \strut \frac{\partial c}{\partial \xi} & \frac{\partial c}{\partial \eta} & 1+\frac{\partial c}{\partial \zeta} \end{pmatrix}, \label{changejac}
\end{equation}
with determinant $\det(J) = 1+\frac{\partial c}{\partial \zeta}$.  For a generic, smooth function $f(\bx)$ defined on $\Omega^n$ the transformation defines $\tilde f(\bxi) = f(\bx(\bxi))$ on $\Lambda$ with gradient $\grad_{\bxi} \tilde f = J^\top \grad_{\bx} f$.  Thus
\begin{equation}
\grad_{\bx} f = (J^\top)^{-1} \grad_{\bxi} \tilde f = \begin{pmatrix} \strut 1 & 0 & - \frac{\partial c}{\partial \xi} \hat\ell \\ \strut 0 & 1 & -\frac{\partial c}{\partial \eta} \hat\ell \\ \strut 0 & 0 & \hat\ell \end{pmatrix} \grad_{\bxi} \tilde f. \label{changegrad}
\end{equation}
where $\hat\ell(\bxi) = \left(1+\frac{\partial c}{\partial \zeta}\right)^{-1}=\det(J)^{-1}$.  Finally, regarding derivatives of vector fields, it follows from \eqref{changegrad} that for $\tilde \bu(\bxi) = \bu(\bx(\bxi)) = \left<\tilde u,\tilde v, \tilde w\right>$ we have
\begin{equation}
\grad_{\bx} \cdot \bu = \grad_{\bxi} \cdot \tilde\bu - \hat\ell \left(\frac{\partial c}{\partial \xi} \frac{\partial \tilde u}{\partial \zeta} + \frac{\partial c}{\partial \eta} \frac{\partial \tilde v}{\partial \zeta}\right) + (\hat\ell-1) \frac{\partial \tilde w}{\partial \zeta} \label{changediv}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}

             - \hat\ell \begin{pmatrix} \frac{\partial c}{\partial \xi} \frac{\partial \tilde u}{\partial \zeta} & \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\partial c}{\partial \eta} \frac{\partial \tilde u}{\partial \zeta} + \frac{\partial c}{\partial \xi} \frac{\partial \tilde v}{\partial \zeta}\right) & \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial c}{\partial \xi} \frac{\partial \tilde w}{\partial \zeta} \\ \square & \frac{\partial c}{\partial \eta} \frac{\partial \tilde v}{\partial \zeta} & \strut \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial c}{\partial \eta} \frac{\partial \tilde w}{\partial \zeta} \\ \strut \square & \square & 0 \end{pmatrix}

\end{equation}
where the squares indicate symmetric entries.

Observe that the smooth change of coordinates $\bxi \mapsto \bx$ is not invertible where $\frac{\partial c}{\partial \zeta}=-1$.  In such a column the map \eqref{changecoords} will eliminate all the ice.  On the other hand, if $\Delta t$ is not too large and the glacier is nearly in equilibrium with its climate then we expect $\left|\frac{\partial c}{\partial \zeta}\right| \ll 1$, in which case invertibility is not a concern.

As we need to compute well-posed time steps over the reference domain $\Lambda$, we regularize the computation of the Jacobian determinant as follows.  Let $\delta > 0$ be a small number and define the (unhatted) function
\begin{equation}
j(\bxi) = \frac{1}{2} \left(1 + \frac{\partial c}{\partial \zeta} + \left[\left(1+\frac{\partial c}{\partial \zeta}\right)^2 + \delta^2\right]^{1/2}\right), \label{definej}
\end{equation}
% alternative:  j(\bxi) = \max\left\{1+\frac{\partial c}{\partial \zeta}, \delta\right\}
so that $j(\bxi) > \max\left\{1+\frac{\partial c}{\partial \zeta}, 0\right\}$, and
\begin{equation}
\ell(\bxi) = j(\bxi)^{-1}. \label{defineell}
\end{equation}
Formulas \eqref{changediv} and \eqref{changeDu} will be used in stating the coupled weak form in the next section, and regularized functions $j$ and $\ell$ from \eqref{definej} and \eqref{defineell}, respectively, will appear as coefficients in the integrals.  This makes the integrals finite even in areas where ice is removed, i.e.~even when $\partial c/\partial \zeta$ is negative and $O(1)$ or larger.  Such removal will generate a mass conservation error; the error is forced by the free boundary nature of the problem \cite{Bueler2020}.


\section{Weak forms} \label{sec:weakforms}

Our FE method in section \ref{sec:finiteelement} will solve the weak form of the coupled system consisting of the velocity-pressure equations in section \ref{sec:strongform} plus the vertical displacement problem just described (section \ref{sec:implicitstep}).  We first recall the well-known weak form of the former system, that is, of the (decoupled) Glen-Stokes problem \eqref{regeffvisc}--\eqref{basebc}, separately from surface kinematical concerns.  This provides notation and a starting point from which to state the coupled weak form.

Let $r=(1/n) + 1>1$ and $r'=(1-r^{-1})^{-1}=r/(r-1)=n+1\ge 2$ (the conjugate exponent).  If $n=3$, as in computations, then $r=4/3$ and $r'=4$.  The Sobolev space of velocity fields on $\Omega^t$ with first derivatives in $L^r$ is denoted $W^{1,r}(\Omega^t)^d$ \cite{Evans2010}.  For fixed $t>0$ one seeks a solution from the following spaces:
\begin{align*}
\bu &\in \hat\bV = \left\{\bv \in W^{1,r}(\Omega^t)^d\,:\,\bv\big|_{\underline{\partial} \Omega^t}=\bzero \text{ and } \bv\big|_{\partial_{\text{in}} \Omega^t} = \bu_{\text{in}}\right\}, \\
p &\in \hat Q = L^{r'}(\Omega^t).
\end{align*}
(Hats indicate choices which are preliminary to the coupled case.)  Test functions $\bv \in \hat\bV_0$ and $q\in \hat Q$ will come from nearly the same spaces, but with $\bv=\bzero$ on the inflow boundary if present.  Note that velocities in $\hat\bV$ are generally only once differentiable, and that pressures in $\hat Q$ need not even be continuous.

To derive the weak form we multiply \eqref{stokes} by $\bv\in \hat\bV_0$ and the negative of \eqref{incompagain} by $q\in \hat Q$, then add these and integrate-by-parts in certain integrals.  Using $ds$ for the boundary measure this yields
\begin{equation}
\int_{\Omega^t} 2 \nu_\eps(|D\bu|) D\bu \,:\,D\bv - p (\nabla \cdot \bv) - \left(\nabla \cdot \bu\right) q - \rhoi \mathbf{g} \cdot \bv \,d\bx -\int_{\partial\Omega^t} (\sigma \hbn)\cdot \bv\,ds = 0 \label{nonfunctwo}
\end{equation}
where $\hbn$ is the outward normal on $\partial\Omega^t$.  Note that $\bu,\bv$ now appear with at most first derivatives and $p,q$ without derivatives.  Because $\bv\in \hat\bV_0$, portions of the boundary integral disappear and the stress-free surface condition \eqref{topbc} eliminates the remaining portions.  Thus we have the following functional which is nonlinear in $\bu$, linear in $p$, and linear in the test functions $\bv,q$:
\begin{equation}
\hat F(\bu,p;\bv,q) = \int_{\Omega^t} 2 \nu_\eps(|D\bu|)\, D\bu\,:\,D\bv - p (\nabla \cdot \bv) - \left(\nabla \cdot \bu\right) q - \rhoi \mathbf{g} \cdot \bv \,d\bx. \label{definehatF}
\end{equation}
The final integral in \eqref{definehatF} is the source term.  We say $\bu\in \hat\bV$ and $p\in \hat Q$ solve the decoupled Glen-Stokes weak formulation at time $t>0$ if
\begin{equation}
\hat F(\bu,p;\bv,q) = 0 \qquad \text{ for all } \bv\in \hat\bV_0 \text{ and } q\in \hat Q.  \label{weakdecoupledstokes}
\end{equation}

A nearly-identical formulation of the same problem is proved in \cite[Theorem 3.8]{JouvetRappaz2011} to be well-posed under reasonable assumptions about the domain and the boundary data, including that the ice base $\underline{\partial} \Omega^t$ has positive measure.  Note that if the inflow velocity is zero or absent (i.e.~$\bu_{\text{in}}=\bzero$ or $\partial_{\text{in}} \Omega^t = \emptyset$), and if the source term is also zero because gravity is turned off ($\bg=\bzero$), then the unique solution of \eqref{weakdecoupledstokes} is $\bu=\bzero$ and $p=0$.  That is, the fluid is exclusively gravity driven.

Next we consider the decoupled weak form of the Laplace problem \eqref{claplace}--\eqref{claplacesides} for the vertical displacement $c$ on the reference domain $\Lambda$.  Recall that these equations describe a backward Euler time step of the surface kinematical equation, i.e.~\eqref{backwardeulerske}.  We will weakly impose the top boundary condition \eqref{claplacetop}, because it involves the velocity unknowns.  Let $W_0^{1,2}(\Lambda)$ be the space of $W^{1,2}$ scalar functions on $\Lambda$ which are zero on the base $\underline{\partial} \Lambda$.  We multiply \eqref{claplace} by a test function $e \in W_0^{1,2}(\Lambda)$ and integrate by parts, then use conditions \eqref{claplacebase} and \eqref{claplacesides} to eliminate all but the top boundary integral.  Denoting the boundary measure by $d\sigma$, this defines a bilinear form
\begin{equation}
B(c;e) = \int_\Lambda \grad c \cdot \grad e \,d\bxi + \int_{\overline{\partial} \Lambda} (c - \psi(c,\bu)) e\,d\sigma \label{defineB}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\psi(c,\bu) = \begin{cases} b-\lambda, & h(c) \le b + 0.1\Href \\
                            h^{n-1} + \Delta t\left(\bar a + \bu \cdot \bn_\Lambda\right) - \lambda, & h(c) >b+0.1\Href \end{cases} \label{definepsi}
\end{equation}
from \eqref{claplacetop}.

Note that in the coupled weak form below $\bu$ is a solution variable, not data.  Note that $h=h(c)$ is computed in \eqref{maptoptotop} and that $\bar a$ is defined by \eqref{smbaverage}.  (Functions $b$, $h^{n-1}$, $\bar a$, and $\lambda$ are fixed data in defining form $B$.)  We say $c \in W_0^{1,2}(\Lambda)$ solves the decoupled weak form of the vertical displacement problem \eqref{claplace}--\eqref{claplacesides} if $B(c;e)=0$ for all $e \in W_0^{1,2}(\Lambda)$.

The change of variables defined in the last section allows us to approximate the integrals needed for the coupled weak form.  For a generic, scalar $L^1$ function $f(\bx)$ defined on $\Omega^n$, by the change of variables theorem and definition \eqref{definej} of the regularized determinant $j(\bxi)$ we have
\begin{equation}
\int_{\Omega^n} f(\bx)\,d\bx = \int_\Lambda \tilde f(\bxi) \, \det(J(\bxi))\,d\bxi \approx \int_\Lambda \tilde f(\bxi) \, j(\bxi)\,d\bxi \label{changeintegral}
\end{equation}
where $\tilde f(\bxi) = f(\bx(\bxi))$.

Regarding the coupled weak form, recall that our central idea is to solve for velocity, pressure, and vertical displacement simultaneously on $\Lambda$ so as to determine the updated icy domain $\Omega^n$ via map \eqref{changecoords}.  Thus we add together functionals $\hat F$ from \eqref{definehatF} and $B$ from \eqref{defineB} to form a single coupled form with all integrals over the reference domain $\Lambda$.  Because the domain is different, $\hat F$ needs modification.

Recalling $r = 1+1/n$, let
\begin{align*}
\bV &= \left\{\bv \in W^{1,r}(\Lambda)^d\,:\,\bv\big|_{\underline{\partial} \Lambda}=\bzero \text{ and } \bv\big|_{\partial_{\text{in}} \Lambda} = \bu_{\text{in}}\right\}, \\
Q   &= L^{r'}(\Lambda), \\
W   &= \left\{e \in W_0^{1,2}(\Lambda)\,:\,e\big|_{\underline{\partial} \Lambda} = 0\right\}.
\end{align*}
Let $\bV_0$ be the usual test function space with $\bv\big|_{\partial_{\text{in}} \Lambda} = \bzero$ (if an inflow boundary is present).

For $(\bu,p,c) \in \bV\times Q\times W$ and test functions $(\bv,q,e) \in \bV_0\times Q\times W$ let
\begin{align}
F(\bu,p,c;\bv,q,e) &= \int_{\Lambda} \Big[2 \nu_\eps(|D_\bx\bu|)\, D_\bx\bu\,:\,D_\bx\bv - p (\nabla_\bx \cdot \bv) - \left(\nabla_\bx \cdot \bu\right) q - \rho\, \mathbf{g} \cdot \bv\Big] j \,d\bxi \notag \\
&\qquad + \int_\Lambda \grad c \cdot \grad e \,d\bxi + \int_{\overline{\partial} \Lambda} (c - \psi(c,\bu)) e\,d\sigma. \label{defineF}
\end{align}
% FIXME should \psi(c,\bu) be regularized?
In the first integral the density $j$ is defined by \eqref{definej}.  Divergences $\grad_\bx \cdot$ and strain rate tensors $D_\bx$ are given by expressions \eqref{changediv} and \eqref{changeDu} with $\ell$, defined by \eqref{defineell}, replacing $\hat\ell$.  Function $\psi$ is defined in \eqref{definepsi}.

This definition of our coupled functional $F$ involves multiple regularizations and modifications.  The reader deserves a summary; we must not sweep-under-the-rug the following aspects of the implicit geometry update:
\begin{itemize}
\item ``$+\eps D_0^2$'' in formula \eqref{regeffvisc} for the nonlinear viscosity, using $\eps>0$ and $D_0>0$,
\item the replacement of $x=1+\frac{\partial c}{\partial \zeta}$ by $\max\{x,0\}$ in defining $j$ in \eqref{definej},
\item additionally ``$+\delta^2$'' in defining $j$ by \eqref{definej}, thus $\ell$ by \eqref{defineell},
\item the normal direction $\hat n$ on the top boundary of the updated domain $\Omega^n$, in applying the (natural) stress-free condition, now uses $\bn_\Lambda$ instead, and
\item the normal direction in the surface kinematical equation, inside \eqref{definepsi} defining $\psi$, also uses $\bn_\Lambda$ instead of the normal on $\Omega^n$.
\end{itemize}
The first of these is well known, but the others are aspects of our (new) approach to implicit time steppping.  Collectively these regularizations remove singularities from the integrals in \eqref{defineF}.

By definition, the solution of the coupled weak form is a list of three functions, the velocity $\bu \in \bV$, the pressure $p\in Q$, and the vertical displacement $c\in W$, such that $F(\bu,p,c;\bv,q,e) = 0$ for all test functions $\bv$, $q$, $e$ from the same spaces (modulo $\bV\to\bV_0$).  All of these functions are defined on the domain $\Lambda$ which is fixed for the duration of the time step; it is this domain which will be meshed in the FE method.  Assuming that $\Lambda$ is a well-behaved domain we expect this boundary-value problem to be well-posed, and supporting numerical evidence appears in sections \ref{sec:results} and \ref{sec:validation}, but this mathematical issue is definitely \emph{not} resolved in this paper.

%FIXME:  perhaps we should be solving a variational inequality subject to \frac{\partial c}{\partial \zeta} \ge -1 *and* regularizing the weak form stretching factors to keep \ell bounded (which is done)

FIXME not appreciated that, while for explicit time-stepping schemes the surface mass balance need only be computed at the current ice surface, and at neighboring ice-free locations, in implicit time stepping the surface mass balance must be available to the evolving-geometry model (specifically to the residual-evaluation code) at every location in a 3D neighborhood of the ice surface, and indeed at all 3D locations above the bedrock elevation; a ``potential ice surface mass balance'' is needed at all such locations

\appendix
\section{The shallow ice approximation and its solutions}

The shallow ice approximation (SIA), a widely-used simplified model for the flow of grounded, non-sliding ice \cite{SchoofHewitt2013}, is applied in this paper only for comparison purposes.  It is derived by a small-parameter argument which we recall from Chapter 18 of \cite{Fowler1997}; similar arguments appear in other sources e.g.~\cite{GreveBlatter2009}.

Let $[H]$, $[L]$, $[U]$, and $[\tau]$ denote typical thickness, horizontal extent, horizontal velocity, and vertical-plane shear stress values, respectively, of a glacier.  We consider $\eps = [H]/[L]$ as the small parameter; for a mountain glacier we might have $\eps \approx 0.1$ but for the Greenland ice sheet $\eps \in (10^{-3},10^{-2})$ is reasonable.  We scale the kinematic variables $x,y \sim [L]$, $z \sim [H] = \eps [L]$, $u,v \sim [U]$, and $w \sim \eps [U]$.\footnote{Recall this means, for example, that we introduce new ``hatted'' variables via $x=[L]\hat x$, $y=[L]\hat y$, and $z=[H] \hat z$.  The equations are rewritten in the new variables and then the hats are removed.}  We suppose stress components $\tau_{xz},\tau_{yz}$ scale with $[\tau]$ and $\tau_{xx},\tau_{yy},\tau_{xy}$ with $\eps[\tau]$.   The pressure perturbation from the hydrostatic condition, namely $p-\rhoi g (h - z)$, is scaled with $\eps [\tau]$ also; this means that $p-\rhoi g (h - z)=\eps[\tau]\hat{\delta p}$.  With these scalings, plus certain additional relationships among the scale factors \cite{Fowler1997}, equation \eqref{forcebalance} yields
    $$\frac{\partial\tau_{xz}}{\partial z} + O(\eps^2) = \frac{\partial h}{\partial x}, \qquad \frac{\partial\tau_{yz}}{\partial z} + O(\eps^2) = \frac{\partial h}{\partial y}.$$
The shear strain rates are dominated by the $z$ derivatives of the horizontal velocity, thus
    $$\tau_{xz} = \nu\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial z} + \eps^2 \frac{\partial w}{\partial z}\right), \qquad \tau_{yz} = \nu\left(\frac{\partial v}{\partial z} + \eps^2 \frac{\partial w}{\partial y}\right).$$
Also, the norm of the deviatoric stress satisfies $|\tau|^2 = \tau_{xz}^2 + \tau_{yz}^2 + O(\eps^2)$ and the stress-free condition at the surface $z=h$ becomes $\tau_{xz} = O(\eps^2)$ and $\tau_{yz} = O(\eps^2)$.  Note that incompressibility \eqref{incompressible} is unaltered by the scaling.

The strong form of the SIA arises from dropping terms of order $O(\eps^2)$ from the scaled equations and returning to the original, unscaled variables.  In order to compactly state these equations let $\bm{\tau}=\left<\tau_{xz},\tau_{yz}\right>$ denote the remaining shear stress components and $\bm{\omega}=\left<\frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial u}{\partial z},\frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial v}{\partial z}\right>$ the corresponding strain rates.  Note that \eqref{viscflowlaw} implies $|\bm{\tau}|=B_n |\bm{\omega}|^{1/n}$, where $|\cdot|$ denotes the ordinary Euclidean norm on $\RR^2$, and thus that $\bm{\omega} = A_n |\bm{\tau}|^{n-1} \bm{\tau}$ where $A_n=(B_n)^{-n}$.  We now have the following equations for the shear stresses and the velocity,
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\bm{\tau}}{\partial z} = \rhoi g \grad h, \qquad \Div \bu = 0, \qquad \bm{\omega} = A_n |\bm{\tau}|^{n-1} \bm{\tau}, \label{siavectorized}
\end{equation}
subject to $\bm{\tau}=0$ at the surface $z=h$ and $\bu=0$ on the base $z=b$.

The SIA stress equations \eqref{siavectorized} can be vertically-integrated to give a formulas for the horizontal velocity.  A first integral gives $\bm{\tau} = - \rhoi g (h-z) \grad h$, thus
    $$\left<\frac{\partial u}{\partial z},\frac{\partial v}{\partial z}\right> = - 2 A_n (\rhoi g)^n (h-z)^n |\grad h|^{n-1} \grad h.$$
Integrating again we determine the horizontal velocity at any point within the ice:
\begin{equation}
\left<u,v\right> = - \frac{2 A_n (\rhoi g)^n}{n+1} \left((h-b)^{n+1} - (h-z)^{n+1}\right) |\grad h|^{n-1} \grad h.  \label{siavelocity}
\end{equation}

The result in \eqref{siavelocity} is not actually our model for ice flow, but rather it has three ancillary purposes.  First, in combination with the hydrostatic pressure computation $p=\rhoi g (h-z)$, and vertical integration of the incompressibility equation to approximate $w$, it provides a fast computation of an initial iterate for a nonlinear Stokes solver.  Second, the computation of \eqref{siavelocity} on a given mesh defines our ``work unit'' when evaluating Stokes solver performance on that mesh.  Third, when combined with the surface kinematical equation, \eqref{siavelocity} can be used to derive a nonlinear and degenerate diffusion equation for the ice sheet thickness \cite{Fowler1997}.  We will use the following exact similarity solution of this diffusion equation as a source of synthetic ice sheet initial states in certain numerical experiments.

This solution arises from the $n=3$, flat-bed ($b=0$), and zero surface mass balance ($a=0$) case.  By integrating equation \eqref{siavelocity} vertically one may show that the scaled surface kinematical equation implies that the evolving ice thickness function $H(t,x,y)\ge 0$ solves
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial H}{\partial t} = \Gamma \Div \left(H^5 |\grad H|^2 \grad H\right). \label{sia}
\end{equation}
on the set where $H>0$ \cite{Fowler1997}, where $\Gamma = \frac{2}{5} A_3 (\rhoi g)^3$.  References \cite{Bueler2016,Calvoetal2002,JouvetBueler2012} consider the rigorous meaning of this free boundary problem.  P.~Halfar \cite{Halfar1981} observed that \eqref{sia} has an exact similarity solution with $\lim_{t\to 0} H$ equal to a Dirac delta function, and that this solution is asymptotically stable.  In 3D \cite{Halfar1983} the solution is a circular dome which spreads radially while thinning, with constant-in-time total volume.  Denoting the radial coordinate as $r=(x^2+y^2)^{1/2}$, the solution is of the form $H(t,r) = t^{-\alpha} \varphi(s)$ with similarity variable $s=t^{-\beta} r$ and $\alpha=1/9$ and $\beta=1/18$.  If a center thickness $H_0$ and radius $R_0$ are given then, on the set where $H$ is positive \cite{Bueleretal2005},
\begin{equation}
H(t,x,y) = H_0 \left(\frac{t}{t_0}\right)^{-\alpha} \left\{1 - \left[\left(\frac{t}{t_0}\right)^{-\beta} \frac{r}{R_0}\right]^{4/3}\right\}^{3/7}. \label{halfar}
\end{equation}
The characteristic time is found by $t_0 = (\beta/\Gamma) (7/4)^3 R_0^4 H_0^{-7}$.  The corresponding 2D Halfar solution $H(t,x)$ \cite{Halfar1981}, in one horizontal dimension, is of the same form as \eqref{halfar} but with $r$ replaced by $x$ and with $\alpha=\beta=1/11$.
